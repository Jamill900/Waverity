The interest in these fields is that they have a large number of wells that allow you to check the performance of the S.I.Q.E. methodology. At the same time, it is important to note that both fields have different seismic qualities and also that various data acquisition methods were used in their collection. Specifically, towed streamer for the ACG field and ocean bottom seismic for the SD field.\\n\\n In general, we can highlight the key facts from the obtained results. Quantitatively, the high-frequency components were seen to be enhanced over various time intervals. On average, the outcomes have 15 Hz more frequency bandwidth compared to the initial cubes. At the time, an increase in the signal-to-noise ratio of 35% was observed. As a result of the enhancement of the high-frequency components and broadening of the bandwidth, there is also an increase in the dominant frequency values of 56% and, consequently, an increase in resolution of 38%. These results were obtained within a few weeks in comparison to traditional methods, which require several months.\\n\\n Due to the large availability of well data, various analyses were carried out. One of which demonstrated a good match of seismic events between synthetic seismic data and enhanced seismic volumes. This indicates that the observed seismic events are consistent with the actual logging data. In parallel, comparisons were made with the vertical seismic profile (VSP) data, which led to similar conclusions. Finally, statistical analysis showed a better fit between the seismic responses interpreted from the enhanced seismic volume and the geological units determined using a standard set of well logs from drilled wells and consistent assumptions.',\n        date: '6 April 2022'\n      }, {\n        id: 16,\n        cover: 'assets/images/oil2.gif',\n        title: 'The next product of WAVERITY: Improvement of SNR based on Seismic Image Noise Attenuation (S.I.N.A.) technique',\n        info: 'WAVERITY team developed an in-house tool for increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of seismic reflectivity data.

Unlike conventional methods, the developed algorithm does not require a lot of parameterizations and the desired output can be obtained within a short time interval. Moreover, it is important to note that this methodology does not need any well data and completely depends only on the original seismic data.\\n\\n The robustness of S.I.N.A. has been tested on a number of open-source data as well as on several real fields from the South Caspian Basin, such as Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli and Shah Deniz.
